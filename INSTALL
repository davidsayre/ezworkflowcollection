eZWorkflowCollection extension for eZPublish


Requirements
============
eZPublish 4.3 or later


Installing the extension
========================
1. Download the package.

2. Copy the downloaded package into the 'extension' directory of your
   eZPublish installation.

3. Unpack the files in the distribution.

4. Add a table in the database used by your eZ Publish instance. You can do so as follows
   ( from eZ Publish's root directory ), in the case you are using MySQL:

   $> mysql -u<user> -p<password> <database_name> < extension/ezworkflowcollection/sql/mysql/schema.sql

   The procedure is very similar in case you are using another RDMS. You may want to have a look at the
   sql/oracle and sql/postgresql for Oracle and PostgreSQL databases respectively.
   Please refer to the documentation reference for your DBMS if you are experiencing issues.

5. Enable the extension in eZ publish.
   Regenerate the extensions autoloads config if enabling the extension by hand.

6. Clear the caches for the administration interface

7. Create new workflows from administration interface Setup/Workflows

8. Plug workflow to the corresponding triggers Setup/Triggers

9. If using the approveaddlocation event, please do not use the standard "workflow" cronjob part
   anymore, but use "workflow2" instead, to work aroung bug EZP-16913.

10. Have fun !!!
